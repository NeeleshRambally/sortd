# Running the application 

- built using node version 18
1. npm install
2. Build: npm run build
3. Run: npm run serve

Notes:

- I did not get the sqr and sqrt working due to time - the functions exist however I require
to format them inorder to get them to be processed
- In the interest of time I did not add any unit test to test the calculator class
- The calculator class can be formatted a littel better to be made more readable
